The /root/preupgrade/kickstart directory contains various files needed for generating Kickstart used to clone the system.

 * All_installed_packages ... All the installed RPM packages
 * All_changed_file ... All the changed files installed by RPM
 * Users ... All the users found on the system
 * Groups ... All the groups found on the system
 * All_installed_files ... All the files installed by RPM
 * noverifycfg - a file containing a list of files marked 'no verify' in the RPM packages that were not checked by the upgrade scripts. Check the files if you plan to clone the system on a different machine
 * untrackedsystem: The file contains all the files and directories untracked by RPM packages that are not used for common system operations and are located in the system directories. Some of them are user data. If you are planning to move the system to a different machine, you need to deal with these files and directories.
 * untrackedexpected: The file contains the regular files and symlinks that are expected on the system, and that are used for common system runtime operations (for example, runlevels, alternatives, and SELinux active modules). You probably do not need to handle these files.
 * untrackeduser: The file contains all the files and directories untracked by RPM packages in the users' directories. If you plan to move the system to a different machine, you need to deal with these files and directories.
 * untrackedtemporary: The file is informational only, and it contains the files in the temporary directories. You probably do not need to handle these files.
 * nonrhpkgs - this file contains all Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 packages not signed by Red Hat keys. Handle them yourself.

 * RHRHEL7rpmlist_obsoleted - This file contains all Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 packages that were replaced in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 by a not fully compatible alternative, and that are a part of the Base channel. Direct dependency from the packages not signed by Red Hat was not discovered.
 * RHRHEL7rpmlist_obsoleted-required - This file is similar to the RHRHEL7rpmlist_obsoleted file, but in addition these packages are required by the packages not signed by Red Hat. As some of your packages depend on it, check the changes in detail.
 * RHRHEL7rpmlist_obsoleted-notbase - This file is similar to the RHRHEL7rpmlist_obsoleted file, but these packages are not a part of the Base channel in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. Register the new machine, and attach subscriptions with the correct repositories if you want to install them.
 * RHRHEL7rpmlist_obsoleted-required-notbase - This file is similar to the RHRHEL7rpmlist_obsoleted-required and RHRHEL7rpmlist_obsoleted-notbase files. The packages are required by the packages not signed by Red Hat, and they are not a part of the Base channel.
 * RemovedPkg-optional - Similar to the RemovedPkg-required file, but in this case, no package not signed by Red Hat requires this. It is more of an informational thing for you, so that you can deal with the unavailability of these packages.

 * RHRHEL7rpmlist_replaced - This file contains a list of packages that replace the original Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 packages on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 system, and that are available in the Base channel. These packages will always be installed.
 * RHRHEL7rpmlist_replaced-notbase - This file is similar to the RHRHEL7rpmlist_replaced file, but the packages are a part of other channels, and they must be installed manually.

  * RHRHEL7rpmlist_kept - This file contains a list of packages that you have installed on your system, and that are available on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 system in the Base channel. These packages will be installed automatically.
  * RHRHEL7rpmlist_kept-notbase - This file is similar to the RHRHEL7rpmlist_kept file, but the packages are available from other channels. You will probably need to install them manually.
 * partitions - a copy of the /proc/partitions system file, it can be used in Kickstart for a disk layout
 * fstab - a copy of automated system mountpoints from the /etc/fstab file
 * lsblk_list - a list of block devices generated by the 'lsblk --list' command
 * pvs_list - a list of physical volumes generated by the 'pvs' command 
 * vgs_list - a list of volume groups generated by the 'vgs' command 

 * SonameBumpedLibs-required: This file contains all Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 libraries from your system where the soname version changed. As some of your packages depend on these libraries, rebuild these packages against their corresponding library.
 * SonameBumpedLibs-optional: This file is similar to the SonameBumpedLibs-required file, but in this case no package not signed by Red Hat requires these libraries. It is more of an informational thing for you, so that you can deal with a potential required rebuild.
 
 * NoSonameBumpLibs: This informational file displays all sonames of libraries, where the soname is the same in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. If your binaries not signed by Red Hat depend on these libraries only, they might work without being rebuilt after the upgrade.

 * RemovedLibs-required: This file contains all Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 libraries that were removed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. As some of your packages depend on these libraries, check for alternative solutions.
 * RemovedLibs-optional: This file is similar to the RemovedLibs-required file, but in this case no package not signed by Red Hat requires these libraries. It is more of an informational thing for you, so that you can deal with the unavailability of these libraries.
